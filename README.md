# Cafeteria-Management--System-Cpp
"The "Cafeteria Management" project in C++ is a console-based application that assists in managing a cafeteria's operations. This project includes features for tracking and managing the inventory of various food items like burgers, ice creams, pizzas, cold drinks, and sandwiches. Additionally, it offers a billing system for customers and maintains a record of their bills. Here's a brief overview of the project's functionality:

Inventory Management: The project allows you to manage the stock of different food items by specifying the quantity purchased, cost price, selling price, and quantity sold for each item.

Billing System: You can use the billing system to generate bills for customers. It prompts you to enter the number of products a customer has purchased and then records the item name, quantity, and price per item. It calculates and displays the total bill amount.

Customer Record: The project enables you to record customer bill details, including their name, bill amount, day, and date. These records are stored in a file for future reference.

Customer Bill Details: You can view the customer bill records, which display customer names, bill amounts, days, and dates.
